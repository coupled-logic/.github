## Hi there and welcome to the github profile page for Coupled Logic ðŸ‘‹

### Who are we?
#### Coupled Logic are a consultancy who operate around the interface of consumers, businesses and AI to help create a collaborative intelligence that is greater than the sum of it's parts. Hence our name!

### Our vision
#### We are aware that generative AI, or in it's current form as Large Language Models (LLMs) are here to stay.
#### We believe that by using AI, all businesses stand to have a drastic uplift in terms of efficiency and optimization, and we believe that consumers and employees alike can benefit directly by developing tools enabling all parties the most effective leveraging of this new technology.

### What do we do?
#### Enabling businesses to leverage AI effectively can involve tasks like facilitating the training of custom language models to help steamline things like customer service or sales pipielines.

### Do you have a website?
#### Our website is currently under construction and the link will be placed in here when we have finished creating our showcase

### Can I follow you on social media?
#### Please do! Our social links will be added here in the not-too-distant future, but for now, feel free to explore our public repositories and watch this space
